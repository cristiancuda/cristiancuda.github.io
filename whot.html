Power Point Presentations
#1	Introduction, Geography and Pre-Roman Spain
1.	What do we mean by culture?  What do the words Latino or Hispanic mean? 
Culture refers to how we relate to each other in a community, including our common language, foods, arts, beliefs, religions, gender relations, and history.  Briefly, culture refers to the ways of living built up by a group and passed on from one generation to another. 
Latino: a person living in the U.S. who speaks Spanish (learned at home) or had an ancestor that spoke Spanish.

2.	To what principal continents do we return to uncover Latino roots?
Latino (or Hispanic) are “cover terms,” or terms that, like an umbrella, attempt to incorporate many different families in one broad category (i.e., families whose roots lie in Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas
3.	Why is knowing the geography of Spain (Iberian Peninsula) key to understanding its first peoples and history? 

-Geography can shape the cultures of the peoples in a region. For example, different languages and customs can develop in different parts of a region separated by mountain ranges. This is exactly what happened in Spain where in addition to Spanish other languages are spoken today.

4.	Be able to identify major geographic features and cities as presented in PowerPoint Presentation.

•	When were the Jews who refused to convert to Christianity expelled from Spain? 
Nevertheless, in the same year that Granada fell to the Christians (1492), the reigning monarchs—Isabella and Ferdinand—decided to expel all Jews who did not convert to Christianity. This was a tragic decision that forced some 30,000 - 40,000 Jewish families to leave a homeland that their ancestors claimed as their own for thousands of years
•	Who are the Sephardic Jews? 
Exiled Spanish Jews moved to northern Africa, Turkey, Italy, Greece and other Mediterranean lands. They become known as Sephardic Jews (Sefarad = Hebrew name for Spain).

#5 	Renaissance and the Golden Age in Spain
•	What is the period called the Spanish Renaissance?  Who are the important rulers during this period in Spain? 
-Important period of weather civilization that began the 14th century 
-Meaning rebirth  this cultural trend thrived on renewed interest in the classic Greeks and romans in there literature, philosophy, art ,and architecture 
-Greeks and latins got new life 

-Isabella and Ferdinand - In Spain, the Renaissance begin to flourish in the 15th century, especially during the reign of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Isabella (of Castile) and Ferdinand (of Aragón) married in 1469, thus uniting most of the Spanish peninsula under one rule and creating the first modern nation of Western Europe.
- Charles V was the grandson of Isabella and Ferdinand (their son, Juan, had died in 1497). Charles' Father, Phillip, was a Hapsburg, and thus the young Charles inherited not only Spain but also the extensive possessions of the royal family of Austria. In addition to these European possessions (see the map on the next slide), Charles V also governed Spanish territory in the Americas and the Philippines. It was said that the sun never set on the Spanish empire, larger than the old Roman Empire. 
- -Philip II was the son of Charles V, and governed his father's lands from 1556-1598. Whereas Charles spent little time in Spain, Philip ruled from his native country. Both father and son squandered much of the gold and silver of the Americas in countless wars against rebellious subjects, above all Protestants. Especially troublesome were the "low countries" (modern Belgium, Luxembourg, and Holland). In all, the dogmatic world view of the Spanish Counter Reformation was unable to respond to the needs of the diverse peoples under the Spanish Hapsburgs.

•	Fall of Granada
•	●Jews expelled
•	●Columbus sailed under Spanish flag
•	●First Spanish Grammar (Antonio de Nebrija)

•	What is the Golden Age of Spain?  Why was Spain on the decline during this period? 

Golden Age in Spain refers to an appearance of a number of great painters, novelists, poets,  and dramatists roughly between the years 1550 – 1700. 
The wars against the protestants, the squandering of the gold and silver from the Americas, and the weak governments in Madrid caused an abrupt collapse of the once mighty Spanish empire. 

•	Who is Antonio de Nebrija? What is the significance of the book, Gramática de la lengua española, 1492 (Grammar of the Spanish Language)? 
•	1492, Antonio de Nebrija, a University of Salamanca professor,  wrote the first grammar book of a Romance language (Spanish) and personally gave a copy to Isabella (Gramática castellana).
•	 Asked by the Queen what the book was for, Nebrija responded that “siempre la lengua fue compañera del imperio” (language has always been the companion of empire).  This occurred in January of 1492, long before Columbus would return from his first voyage (October), but Nebrija and others sensed that Spain was at a moment of expansion and would need to teach others the Spanish language.

•	Why do you think that Don Quixote is still being read today? 

•	Why has this novel inspired so many imitations in Western European literature?
•	What is Lazarillo de Tormes about?
•	"Lazarillo de Tormes" establishes the format for the picaresque novel, in which a young boy experiences several masters during his growing years. Along the way, social criticism is combined with fiction that, under the pen of a experienced writer, could be highly entertaining. Such was the case with "Lazarillo de Tormes" a best-seller of the Spanish sixteenth-century. Lazarillo was also a banned text; that is to say, its reading and publication was officially prohibited by the Church because of material deemed to be inappropriate for a Christian public (however, as often happens in such cases, many obtained and read the novel -- even priests). This is one reason why the author's name remains unknown: he (or she) probably would have been punished as a heretic by the Spanish Inquisition (the police force of the Church and the monarchy).

Many different communities make up the contemporary population of the Americas. To begin with, there are over 15,000,000 indigenous (native) Americans who can trace their ancestry to families living in North and South America before the European encounter (1492).
Some families may trace their roots to both European and indigenous ancestors; they are the mestizos, daughters and sons of two distinct cultures. Other families may ultimately look to Africa as a source of pride of their past, their distant relatives having been forcibly transported to the Americas a slaves beginning shortly after 1492. 
Other families past and present are from all parts of the globe, including Europe and Asia.

•	What was the location of the Maya civilization? 
Building on the achievements of previous regional cultures, such as the Olmecs, the Maya culture began to expand in the Yucatán Peninsula around 600 B.C., an area about the size of the state of New Mexico.
•	Describe some Maya religious views. 
As we will see in the reading listed for this section (from the Maya Popol Vuh), the gods of the Maya were believed to be capricious, unpredictable, and even hostile to the aspirations of humankind. One way to insure the good will of the supernatural was to offer human blood. On sacred occasions, the king might pierce the foreskin of his penis and allow blood to drip on thin pieces of bark that were later burned; the queen would pierce her tongue with a small cord to produce the blood that would please the gods. Enemy soldiers and even captured kings from other cities were offered up to the great Maya divinities.

Precise calendars, astronomical calculations, and monumental architecture are also hallmarks of the Maya culture.

•	Where is Tikal and why is it an important city? 
ikal (tee-KAL) is a ruined Maya city located in the northern Petén province of Guatemala. During the heyday of the Maya Empire, Tikal was a very important and influential city, controlling vast stretches of territory and dominating smaller city-states. Like the rest of the great Mayan cities Tikal fell into decline around 900 A.D. or so and was eventually abandoned. It is currently an important archaeological and tourism site.
